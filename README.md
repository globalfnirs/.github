# Welcome to Global fNIRS

Global fNIRS is a multidisciplinary project dedicated to advancing global health initiatives through the use of a low cost, portable and non-invasive neuroimaging technology, functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).  Our goal is to provide tools which supplement current methods for assessing cognitive function of the developing brain in resource poor settings. We believe that establishing earlier and more objective biomarkers of typical and atypical cognitive development will be of value in assessing interventional outcomes and risk prevention strategies.
